If you go on Youtube and listen to the hype you would think they are on the brink of AGI.  However my experience with AI has been completely different.  The AI I use can't pass high school math courses,  nevermind college level tests.  If I prompt any of the available AI models with questions  they are wrong over 75 of the time.  I am sourcing questions from textbooks,  and only changing the names and variables so that they actually have to solve them and not use memorization.\n\nI challenge anyone here to show me ChatGPT for example solving complicated problems in math,  chemistry,  or programming.\n\nMy experience with AI programming is even worse then my chemistry and math quiz's.  They seemingly understand the question but their implementation does not follow details and is an hallucination more often then not.\n\nIm just going to leave a very very very very simple math problem.\n\nJohn deposited 10,500 into a 3year certificate of deposit that earned 4.75 annual interest, compounded annually.

As promised, I'll write a longer post about how I entered the world of ML, hoping it will help someone shape their path. I'll include links to all the useful materials I used alongside the story, which you can use for learning.\n\nI like to call myself an AI Research Scientist who enjoys exploring new AI trends, delving deeper into understanding their background, and applying them to real products. This way, I try to connect science and entrepreneurship because I believe everything that starts as scientific research ends up on the shelves as a product that solves a specific user problem.\n\nI began my journey in ML in 2016 when it wasn't such a popular field. Everyone had heard of it, but few were applying it. I have several years of development experience and want to try my hand at ML. The first problem I encountered was where to start  whether to learn mathematics, statistics, or something else. That's when I came across a name and a course that completely changed my career.\n\n Let's start\n\nYou guessed it. It was Professor Andrew Ng and his globally popular Machine Learning course available on Coursera I still have the certificate, hehe. This was also my first official online course ever. Since that course no longer exists as it's been replaced by a new one, I recommend you check out\n\n1. Machine Learning Stanford CS229httpswww.youtube.complaylist?listPLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU\n2. Machine Learning Specializationhttpswww.coursera.orgspecializationsmachinelearningintroduction\n\nThese two courses start from the basics of ML and all the necessary calculus you need to know. Many always ask questions like whether to learn linear algebra, statistics, or probability, but you don't need to know everything in depth. This knowledge helps if you're a scientist developing a new architecture, but as an engineer, not really. You need to know some basics to understand, such as how the backpropagation algorithm works.\n\nI know that Machine Learning Stanford CS229 is a very long and arduous course, but it's the right start if you want to be really good at ML. In my time, I filled two thick notebooks by hand while taking the course mentioned above.\n\n TensorFlow and Keras\n\nAfter the course, I didn't know how to apply my knowledge because I hadn't learned specifically how to code things. Then, I was looking for ways to learn how to code it. That's when I came across a popular framework called Keras, now part of TensorFlow. I started with a new course and acquiring practical knowledge\n\n1. Deep Learning Specializationhttpswww.coursera.orgspecializationsdeeplearning\n2. Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellowhttpswww.deeplearningbook.org\n3. Machine Learning Yearning by Andrew Nghttpsinfo.deeplearning.aimachinelearningyearningbook\n\nThese resources above were my next step. I must admit that I learned the most from that course and from the book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow because I like reading books although this one is quite difficult to read.\n\n Learn by coding\n\nTo avoid just learning, I went through various GitHub repositories that I manually retyped and learned that way. It may be an oldfashioned technique, but it helped me a lot. Now, most of those repositories don't exist, so I'll share some that I found to be good\n\n1. Really good Jupyter notebooks that can teach you the basics of TensorFlowhttpsgithub.commrdbourketensorflowdeeplearning\n2. Another good repo for learning TF and Kerashttpsgithub.comcodebasicsdeeplearningkerastftutorial\n\n Master the challenge\n\nAfter mastering the basics in terms of programming in TFKeras, I wanted to try solving some real problems. There's no better place for that challenge than Kaggle and the popular Titanic dataset. Here, you can really find a bunch of materials and simple examples of ML applications. Here are some of my favorites\n\n1. Titanic  Machine Learning from Disasterhttpswww.kaggle.comctitanicoverview\n2. Home Credit Default Riskhttpswww.kaggle.comcompetitionshomecreditdefaultriskoverview\n3. House Prices  Advanced Regression Techniqueshttpswww.kaggle.comcompetitionshousepricesadvancedregressiontechniques\n4. Two Sigma Using News to Predict Stock Movementshttpswww.kaggle.comcompetitionstwosigmafinancialnews\n\nI then decided to further develop my career in the direction of applying ML to the stock market, first using predictions on time series and then using natural language processing. I've remained in this field until today and will defend my doctoral dissertation soon.\n\n How to deploy models\n\nTo continue, before I move on to the topic of specialization, we need to address the topic of deployment. Now that we've learned how to make some basic models in Keras and how to use them, there are many ways and services, but I'll only mention what I use today. For all my ML models, whether simple regression models or complex GPT models, I use FastAPI. It's a straightforward framework, and you can quickly create API endpoints. I'll share a few older and useful tutorials for beginners\n\n1. AI as an API tutorial serieshttpswww.youtube.comwatch?v56qQNcHJxyQ\n2. A stepbystep guidehttpsmedium.comganiyuabdulwajeed2002astepbystepapproachtobuildingafastapifordeeplearningclassificationprojectscbd2ea6bc2f2\n3. Productizing an ML Model with FastAPI and Cloud Runhttpsmedium.comsemantixbrdeployanmlmodelwithfastapiandcloudrunpart11a0b0f3b3a5d\n\nPersonally, I've deployed on various cloud providers, of which I would highlight GCP and AWS because they have everything needed for model deployment, and if you know how to use them, they can be quite cheap.\n\n Chose your specialization\n\nThe next step in developing my career, besides choosing finance as the primary area, was my specialization in the field of NLP. This happened in early 2020 when I started working with models based on the Transformer architecture. The first model I worked with was BERT, and the first tasks were related to classifications. My recommendations are to master the Transformer architecture well because 99 of today's LLM models are based on it. Here are some resources\n\n1. The legendary paper Attention Is All You Needhttpsproceedings.neurips.ccpaper_filespaper2017file3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aaPaper.pdf\n2.

Good repositoryhttpsgithub.comNielsRoggeTransformersTutorials\n5. How large language models work, a visual intro to transformershttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vwjZofJX0v4M\n\nAfter spending years using encoderbased Transformer models, I started learning GPT models. Good opensource models like Llama 2 then appear. Then, I started finetuning these models using the excellent Unsloth library\n\n1. How to Finetune Llama3 and Export to Ollamahttpsdocs.unsloth.aitutorialshowtofinetunellama3andexporttoollama\n2. Finetune Llama 3.1 UltraEfficiently with Unslothhttpshuggingface.coblogmlabonnesftllama3\n\nAfter that, I focused on studying various RAG techniques and developing Agent AI systems. This is now called AI engineering, and, as far as I can see, it has become quite popular. So I'll write more about that in another post, but here I'll leave what I consider to be the three most famous representatives, i.e., their tutorials\n\n1. LangChain tutorialhttpspython.langchain.comdocstutorials\n2. LangGraph tutorialhttpslangchainai.github.iolanggraphtutorials\n3. CrewAI exampleshttpsgithub.comcrewAIInccrewAIexamples\n\n Here I am today\n\nThanks to the knowledge I've generated over all these years in the field of ML, I've developed and worked on numerous projects. The most significant publicly available project is developing an agent AI system for wellbeing support, which I turned into a mobile applicationhttpssintelly.comdownload. Also, my entire doctoral dissertation is related to applying ML to the stock market in combination with the development of GPT models and reinforcement learning more on that in a separate post. After long 6 years, I've completed my dissertation, and now I'm just waiting for its defense. I'll share everything I'm working on for the dissertation publicly on the projecthttpsprimoinvesting.com, and in tutorials I'm preparing to write.\n\nIf you're interested in these topics, I announce that I'll soon start with activities of publishing content on Medium and a blog, but I'll share all of that here on Reddit as well. Now that I've gathered years of experience and knowledge in this field, I'd like to share it with others and help as much as possible.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask them, and I'll try to answer all of them.\n\nThank you for reading.","intent":"machine learning"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Throughout my computer science education and software engineering career, there was an emphasis on correctness.

I do know many friends that work on the experimental side, though.\n\nAs much as I appreciate the interest in my field over the last year or so, I personally think it's best to keep expectations realistic. Especially with some DD posts I have seen posting incomplete information, and even blatantly false statements in Physics. I want to clear those up and some personal thoughts on some quantum computing startups.\n\nQuantum communication doesn't allow for fasterthanlight propagation of information\n\nI have seen a DD post that says IonQ achieved faster than light communication via networked entanglement of particles. VERY common misconception about entanglement. Affecting one particle in a pair of entangled particles does not affect the other, it will just break the entanglement. It is proven to be impossible via the nocommunication theoremhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiNocommunication_theorem.\n\nBreaking Cryptography, more like breaking your portfolio as you baghold for 1020 years\n\nYes, Shor's algorithm is real. No, it won't be possible to break encryption until we get a quantum computer with at least 2000 qubits. The most optimal implementations  of Shor's algorithm requires around 2n qubits to factor an nbit number.\n\nAs an example for RSA1024, you'll need more than 2000 LOGICAL qubits. Factoring in error correction, which requires multiple PHYSICAL qubits to represent one single logical qubit, you'll most likely need upwards of 100k physical qubits before we can actually break realworld encryption. I personally see that taking at least 20 years, but some more optimistic estimates place it at 10 years.\n\nIonQ\n\nThere's many DD touting IonQ's lower error rates, longer lifetimes, and alltoall connectivity. While all of these are true, they often forget to mention one drawback the gate speeds.\n\nIt takes around a thousand times longer to execute an operation on trapped ion platforms compared to superconducting platforms which Google, IBM uses. While financetechbros that have never touched a quantum mechanics textbook will point to the fact that the lifetime of the qubit is at most on the order of 100 seconds, and think that quantum algorithms won't require more than that time anyways, so this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the algorithms that are most likely to see realworld use are optimization algorithms like VQE and QAOA. These algorithms need to repeat the quantum circuit many, many times as they gradually change the parameters in the circuit to find the optimal set of solutions.\n\nFurthermore, if your circuit output is some continuous variable that's encoded into the probability of measuring one of the states, then you need to repeat the circuit upwards of thousands of time to get a good estimate of that probability.\n\nAs a conservative estimate for a simple optimization algorithm, let's say that you need 1000 repetitions of the circuit, each one taking 1000 repetitions to get the output, and each run of the circuit takes 1 second on a trapped ion computer. That takes 11 and a half days on a trapped ion computer, as compared to 17 minutes on a superconducting one. If we use a paybytheminute model in the future for quantum computers, then IonQ likely has to charge less per minute, since you need more time to run an algorithm on their platform. Sure, they can charge a premium for the lower error rates, but if they charge the same amount per minute as superconducting platforms, then customers are likely to simplify the algorithm they want to run to be more tolerant of errors to get a solution at a thousandth of the price.\n\nRigetti\n\nHonestly, looking at their spec sheets for their platforms, and comparing it to Google's and IBM's, I don't see them pulling ahead at any point. Their board also literally kicked out the original founder for allegedly being a prick in general.\n\nQUBT\n\nLiterally never seen any substantial work from them.\n\nPositions\n\nhttpspreview.redd.it8d3hedfi4rqe1.png?width1080ampformatpngampautowebpampsf5c6f4e97de5dba5f0aa1ce08d44b6e959d16f03\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis is not financial advice.

For long time 64bits was overkill for most programs, and I'm not super knowledgeable about all this, but i imagine we still haven't reached max potential as far as 64bit programming goes.\n\nHold your horses, things still take time. Remember when multi cores was a big deal? Well what programs are using those? I used to occasionally look at my processor analyzer to see if any programs i was running were using my extra cores, i don't think i have ever seen a program use more than 2 cores ever. Most new processors have like 8 or 12? Again I'm not super knowledgeable but i imagine it's cause most programs just don't need it or can't use it, like you can't just tell a program to split a bunch of instructions and send them to various processors, the program is linear and each set of instructions requires the one before it to happen first so it can use those results. Have fun trying to program something that happens all in one instance.\n\nHow does the math work? The beauty of transistors is they can form any logic gate necessary to solve any math equation. I have yet to see a single video that explains how cubits form logic gates or how any math is actually solved with them.\n\nIt's completely flawed, i just watched a video where a scientist explains that on average their quantum computer has an error once every hundred tries, that's an insanely high error rate. I don't care how far science gets, relying on a machine to read particle spins will always sound ridiculous. It's like when they dumped billions of dollars building that particle collider and the only clue they have as to anything actually colliding is finding blips in gigantic stacks of data, and from what i remember the expected data characteristics that indicate a successful appearance of the god particular only occurred once in every several million tries. I'm sure all those starving children are totally stoked on these breakthroughs.\n\nIs there something i missed? What do y'all think? Is quantum computing a load of bs or am i just embarrassing myself?

This is something really overlooked in the marketingHR whatever cybersecurity hype business.\n\nI've worked in cybersecurity for about a year and a half as a technical specialist on an auditing team. My job involves making sure our clients have all their security measures in place, from network segmentation to IAM, IDSIPS, SIEM, and cryptography. I like the overlap with governance, and I also appreciate the opportunity to see a range of different companies and network architectures.\n\nBut if I could go back, I'd start in one of those junior roles I mentioned earlier. Cybersecurity is rooted in a solid understanding of networking, and it can be tough to get into if you don't have any prior experience. Studying the subject and earning certifications can help, of course, but nothing beats the realworld experience of working directly with a large enterprise network.\n\nSo, that's just my personal piece of advice. It's a fantastic field, and you're bound to learn heaps regardless of the path you choose. But don't get too dazzled by the glamour. Be patient, start from the basics, and work your way up. It's worth it, trust me.","intent":"cybersecurity"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"httpspreview.redd.itx8ih1fro28rd1.png?width1303ampformatpngampautowebpamps9e0a0be444f8de4b322b54c4bd2cb82824f63fe5\n\nYes, this is in response to the other guy, and I don't know what he's doing.Current Salary is 220k at a no RSU employer, and I know I could be making much more and will be looking to jump ship in the near future, just have to handle some things at my current employer for a bit.\n\nhttpspreview.redd.itmsojq9ca38rd1.png?width1616ampformatpngampautowebpamps8d8e1e093e4e3eee0ad0f1178ed0d16347550596\n\nEdit\n\nI did not expect this to get that much traction just wanted to show the other side due to the other post earlier. RIP my inbox, unfortunately I can't respond to everyone and I've repeated myself a couple times already so I'll just highlight the most common responses here. These are my opinions feel free to disagree.  \n  \nKnowledge Requisites  \nGetting a degree will certainly help you get your foot into the door in this field but it is not a golden ticket into entry level cyber security jobs. Cyber security exists as a field because IT and networking was built for the purposes of convenience and not for security. In order to understand cyber security fundamentals and concepts you must understand IT and networking at a high to advanced level. I mean how can you secure a bank if you don't know where the vault is or how it works? There's not really schooling that teaches that, you need to get hands on experience whether in a selfdesigned homelab or in the field of IT. Taking a cyber bootcamp or a couple udemycoursera courses is not going to cut it you really need to understand fundamental IT concepts and get your hands dirty. You might know people who got opportunities like that but they are the exception not the rule.  \n  \nDegrees  \nIf you are an undergrad studying computer science and minoring in cyberinformation security is the ideal pathway on my opinion. This way you'll learn programming, networking, IT and security fundamentals all at once. This also depends on your school so be sure to make sure your curriculum tackles all those things. Majoring in cybersecurity is alright as well just be sure the curriculum includes programming and networking courses. This is in addition to getting hands on experience in the field or on your own time as I mentioned above.  \n  \nIf you want to pursue a graduate degree my strongest recommendation is to have your employer or someone else pay for it. A Master's degree in cyber security means nothing without the prerequisite experience, I know because I have one and I only did it because it was paid for. Not to say that you won't learn anything but most people in this field value experience over degrees 10 times out of 10. A Master's degree will help you enter higher levels of management but you need experience to get to that level, right?  \n  \nCerts  \nSecurity, Network are the entry level certifications for this fieldb to demonstrate security and networking knowledge. These two certifications without experience will not get you an interview and if it does, be prepared to walk into a nightmare of a job. Other certifications are the CEH and Pentest which will help on the offensive side of things but also help train your mind on security practices. Coupling these certs with some hands on training like hackthebox and tryhackme will help you get she e really great hands on experience. Unfortunately you need to demonstrate this experience with either a job or a nice github profile.  \n  \nCISSP is the golden grail of certs in this fieldeven though it shouldn't be. It is highly respected and gets you past resume filters. If you have no experience do not study for or attempt a CISSP. Firstly you won't be granted one without 45 years experience and secondly no one will hire you.  \n\n\nOSCP is the golden grail for offensive security, but it is not for the faint of heart. This certification is extremely difficult and not entry level at all, do not attempt this without understanding IT fundamentals.\n\nTo recap, entry level certifications are helpful but you still need the requisite experience for them to be of value.\n\nThe Field  \nLot of questions like what is the day to day, and what do you do?   \nThe answer is that it depends. Cybersecurity isn't a single job it is a very broad field. Most domains are technical in nature, but fields like risk and compliance are a bit less technical. SOC analyst is what I would recommend for anyone starting out. A SOC analyst triages security alertsevents to identify if a security incident has taken place. This is a great starting point because it gives exposure to a lot of areas of the field of cybersecurity like Incident Response, Forensics, SIEM engineering, and the like. You also see a lot of attacks which gives you some insight into offensive security and defensive strategies as well. There are many more domains and areas so you really have to do your research and find out what catches your interest.\n\nSummary\n\nGet handson IT experience, get some schoolingfree preferred, take advantage of internships, and get some entry level certs to position yourself to start a career in cybersecurity. IF you're doing it for the money it's not likely to work out for you, sorry we're really good ad identifying BS.","intent":"cybersecurity"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Hi everyone,\nBreaking into cybersecurity has always been tough, but now it's harder than ever. I've been in the field for 7 years, and during that time, I've earned certifications and degrees while working in various roles and industries. Based on my experience and conversations with hiring managers, directors, and VPs, I want to share some hard truths and advice about getting into the field. Keep in mind, this is just my perspectiveit won't apply to everyone, but this is what I've seen.\n\nCertifications Alone Aren't Enough\n\nYears ago, having certifications like Security or CySA was a big deal, but today, they don't hold the same weight. Certifications are still important, but the market is oversaturatedeveryone has them. Hiring managers are looking for more now, like degrees, technical experience, and specialized skills.\n\nIf you're relying solely on certifications, it's not impossible to break into the field, but it's definitely harder than it used to be.\n\nDegrees Are a GameChanger\n\nI've spoken with many hiring managers and VPs, and they've all said the same thing degrees still matter. Employers see them as a sign of a solid foundation in cybersecurity, especially from wellknown schools.\n\nFor example, I earned my master's in Information Security and Privacy from a very reputable school, and it opened doors for me that certifications alone couldn't. Hiring managers have told me to my face during the first week on the job that they only hired me because of the name of my school and how reputable it is.  Of course, there are more accessible options like WGU, but even WGU programs are getting saturated. If you're serious about breaking into the field, a degree paired with certifications is the way to go! \n\nThe Application Security Route\n\nIf you're trying to figure out the best way into cybersecurity, I highly recommend application security. It's one of the most underserved areas in the field, and there aren't enough people specializing in it. Companies are always looking for application security professionals, and it's a great way to stand out in a crowded market.\n\nThe Truth About TikTok Advice\n\nLet me be blunt most TikTok cybersecurity experts are lying or don't have the experience they claim. They make breaking into cybersecurity sound easy, and that's just not true. Many of them are doing it purely for views and clickbait.\n\nThat said, there are a few accounts I've found that give genuinely good advice\n\t\tCyber_Warrior\n\t\tAndrenajee\n\t\tSwenius\n\nThese are the only accounts I trust on TikTok. Everyone else? Ignore them. They're not in the field, they don't know what they're talking about, or they are in the field and just doing it to sell a course or make side money. They're doing more harm than good by misleading people.\n\nAlso, never pay for a mentor or someone promising to help you break into big tech. These people are scamming you. You don't need to pay anyone to succeed in this field. Focus on building real skills and networking with legitimate professionals.\n\nThe GRC Myth\n\nA lot of people think Governance, Risk, and Compliance GRC is an easy way into cybersecurity, but it's not as simple as it seems. Many GRC roles now require technical experience because you need to be able to explain technical issues to nontechnical stakeholders. While it's not impossible to get into GRC without a technical background, it's definitely harder. A better approach is to start with a technical role, like SOC analyst or application security, and transition into GRC later if that's your goal.\n\nAdvice and referrals \n\nLastly, I'm happy to refer people and give more advice but I need to be clear I will only refer Americans. Not to get political but trump is listening to Elon musk and Ramaswamy and bringing in hoards of Indians on H1B visa. The are paying them for a fraction of the cost as they would pay true hard working Americans. Getting tech jobs in general will be extremely hard for Americans. This is the reason why I will only be helping American citizens ONLY. \n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEveryone's journey is different, but this is what I've seen work for myself and others. It takes persistence and dedication, but if you put in the work, you'll get there.\n\nGood luck to everyone working toward their cybersecurity goals!","intent":"cybersecurity"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Been at it for around 10 years now.

Change my mind.\n\nHere is my experience\n\n I spent 8 years studying robotics in total.\n I did 3 internships where I literally paid to work at a robotics company travel, accommodation, zero salary.\n It still took 8 months to find my first job after bachelor's degree, which required moving across the country.\n I could have won many jobs both robotics and software simply by passing the C hiring tests, with no degree. The job I got was literally the only one that asked me robotics theory during the interview, the rest were all Googletype tech interviews.\n After working and further graduate study, it took me 4 months to find a more senior job at a lowertier robotics company. The famous robotics companies want either robotics PhDs, or software engineers from bigname companies so they can boast we are an exMeta exSpaceX exMicrosoft Robotics company lol wut?!.\n Also I noticed a large amount of mechanical and electrical engineering graduates becoming robot engineers and software engineers, simply by cramming for tech style interviews.\n Later we started to get many exUber, exAmazon and exMicrosoft software engineers join our company, with zero robotics experience, after they got firedPIP'd.\n My salary maxed out at 130,000.\n I got laidoff and took a nonrobotics software role while I kept searching, with no luck.\n The companies I'm trying to join are filled with people who did not study robotics engineering, or their previous role was at a nonrobotics company according to my LI research, yet they throw my resume in the trash.\n The need for a personal profile and public contributions. It's easy to showcase projects and opensource code from early in your career, but then later you get papered with NDAs and busy with family.\n\nI love robotics but this is a terrible investment in a career.\n\nThe reality is that a specialized robotics degree is no longer valued because most companies only need a small number of those people, and we now have a glut of PhDs in every specialization of robotics. Just like companies only need a small number of mechanical and electrical engineers to build out the robot product. Or people teach themselves the fundamentals via an online course e.g. Udacity.  \nAlso, like in any tech sector, it is affected by by outsourcing and immigration. Where's my specialist job that I studied for I'm currently resisting getting into SecretMIL work.\n\nAnother issue is that most pure robotics companies are terrible businesses. Every specific industry problem results in a new robotics startup e.g. A robot solution for mail sorting. A robot solution for picking tshirts. Essentially these startups are doing what a Systems Integrator would normally do. So they find a few customers for their specific product, then they struggle. Many are in the valley of death for 610 years. Many spent 100m with no viable product.\n\nI love building robotics but I feel bad when I did all this study and no one invites you to the party.\n\nChange my mind.\n\nltrantgt","intent":"robotics"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Hi regards. Since markets are closed today and we're all bored as fuck, I'm gonna drop some insight on all y'all that want to gamble away your mortgages and college tuitions.\n\nWe've seen a few trends over the last few months where some previouslybeatup tickers went from trash to gold. I'm gonna call this trend shit we thought we'd have in the future because we watched a lot of scifi movies. 2024 was the year of AI, then it was the space stocks RKLB, LUNR, etc. Then it was the flying car stocks ARCH, JOBY, etc. Then we all saw the quantum stock bubble though any regard with a CS degree could have told you the same thing that Jensen did. So, what scifi future shit is left to invest in? Robots, obviously!\n\nExcept, robots, like space rockets, are real. And they're already in market and getting better rapidly. 2025 is the year when they'll really start to go mainstream, largely because software is the biggest limiting factor to how good robots are today. With recent advancements in AI, robots are going to start getting A LOT better.\n\nFurther supporting my bullish thesis is NVIDIA's recent release of their Cosmos Wold Foundation Model  httpsnvidianews.nvidia.comnewsnvidialaunchescosmosworldfoundationmodelplatformtoacceleratephysicalaidevelopment. Why is this a big deal? because, this will really lower the cost of entry for the robot manufacturers as they won't have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to train a vision model by themselves. Now they can just equip their bots with some commodity sensors amp cameras and build out the hardware bot for their use case.\n\nPositions\n\nDue to marketcap requirements here, the only one I can mention is SERV  holding 2000 shares and 20 LEAP contracts for May.\n\nI have a bag of bunch of other tickers in the space that have a 250500M valuation.","intent":"robotics"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"5 days ago  Charge Robotics, founded by MIT alumni, has created a system that automatically assembles and installs completed sections of large solar farms.

As promised, I'll write a longer post about how I entered the world of ML, hoping it will help someone shape their path. I'll include links to all the useful materials I used alongside the story, which you can use for learning.\n\nI like to call myself an AI Research Scientist who enjoys exploring new AI trends, delving deeper into understanding their background, and applying them to real products. This way, I try to connect science and entrepreneurship because I believe everything that starts as scientific research ends up on the shelves as a product that solves a specific user problem.\n\nI began my journey in ML in 2016 when it wasn't such a popular field. Everyone had heard of it, but few were applying it. I have several years of development experience and want to try my hand at ML. The first problem I encountered was where to start  whether to learn mathematics, statistics, or something else. That's when I came across a name and a course that completely changed my career.\n\n Let's start\n\nYou guessed it. It was Professor Andrew Ng and his globally popular Machine Learning course available on Coursera I still have the certificate, hehe. This was also my first official online course ever. Since that course no longer exists as it's been replaced by a new one, I recommend you check out\n\n1. Machine Learning Stanford CS229httpswww.youtube.complaylist?listPLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU\n2. Machine Learning Specializationhttpswww.coursera.orgspecializationsmachinelearningintroduction\n\nThese two courses start from the basics of ML and all the necessary calculus you need to know. Many always ask questions like whether to learn linear algebra, statistics, or probability, but you don't need to know everything in depth. This knowledge helps if you're a scientist developing a new architecture, but as an engineer, not really. You need to know some basics to understand, such as how the backpropagation algorithm works.\n\nI know that Machine Learning Stanford CS229 is a very long and arduous course, but it's the right start if you want to be really good at ML. In my time, I filled two thick notebooks by hand while taking the course mentioned above.\n\n TensorFlow and Keras\n\nAfter the course, I didn't know how to apply my knowledge because I hadn't learned specifically how to code things. Then, I was looking for ways to learn how to code it. That's when I came across a popular framework called Keras, now part of TensorFlow. I started with a new course and acquiring practical knowledge\n\n1. Deep Learning Specializationhttpswww.coursera.orgspecializationsdeeplearning\n2. Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellowhttpswww.deeplearningbook.org\n3. Machine Learning Yearning by Andrew Nghttpsinfo.deeplearning.aimachinelearningyearningbook\n\nThese resources above were my next step. I must admit that I learned the most from that course and from the book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow because I like reading books although this one is quite difficult to read.\n\n Learn by coding\n\nTo avoid just learning, I went through various GitHub repositories that I manually retyped and learned that way. It may be an oldfashioned technique, but it helped me a lot. Now, most of those repositories don't exist, so I'll share some that I found to be good\n\n1. Really good Jupyter notebooks that can teach you the basics of TensorFlowhttpsgithub.commrdbourketensorflowdeeplearning\n2. Another good repo for learning TF and Kerashttpsgithub.comcodebasicsdeeplearningkerastftutorial\n\n Master the challenge\n\nAfter mastering the basics in terms of programming in TFKeras, I wanted to try solving some real problems. There's no better place for that challenge than Kaggle and the popular Titanic dataset. Here, you can really find a bunch of materials and simple examples of ML applications. Here are some of my favorites\n\n1. Titanic  Machine Learning from Disasterhttpswww.kaggle.comctitanicoverview\n2. Home Credit Default Riskhttpswww.kaggle.comcompetitionshomecreditdefaultriskoverview\n3. House Prices  Advanced Regression Techniqueshttpswww.kaggle.comcompetitionshousepricesadvancedregressiontechniques\n4. Two Sigma Using News to Predict Stock Movementshttpswww.kaggle.comcompetitionstwosigmafinancialnews\n\nI then decided to further develop my career in the direction of applying ML to the stock market, first using predictions on time series and then using natural language processing. I've remained in this field until today and will defend my doctoral dissertation soon.\n\n How to deploy models\n\nTo continue, before I move on to the topic of specialization, we need to address the topic of deployment. Now that we've learned how to make some basic models in Keras and how to use them, there are many ways and services, but I'll only mention what I use today. For all my ML models, whether simple regression models or complex GPT models, I use FastAPI. It's a straightforward framework, and you can quickly create API endpoints. I'll share a few older and useful tutorials for beginners\n\n1. AI as an API tutorial serieshttpswww.youtube.comwatch?v56qQNcHJxyQ\n2. A stepbystep guidehttpsmedium.comganiyuabdulwajeed2002astepbystepapproachtobuildingafastapifordeeplearningclassificationprojectscbd2ea6bc2f2\n3. Productizing an ML Model with FastAPI and Cloud Runhttpsmedium.comsemantixbrdeployanmlmodelwithfastapiandcloudrunpart11a0b0f3b3a5d\n\nPersonally, I've deployed on various cloud providers, of which I would highlight GCP and AWS because they have everything needed for model deployment, and if you know how to use them, they can be quite cheap.\n\n Chose your specialization\n\nThe next step in developing my career, besides choosing finance as the primary area, was my specialization in the field of NLP. This happened in early 2020 when I started working with models based on the Transformer architecture. The first model I worked with was BERT, and the first tasks were related to classifications. My recommendations are to master the Transformer architecture well because 99 of today's LLM models are based on it. Here are some resources\n\n1. The legendary paper Attention Is All You Needhttpsproceedings.neurips.ccpaper_filespaper2017file3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aaPaper.pdf\n2.

Good repositoryhttpsgithub.comNielsRoggeTransformersTutorials\n5. How large language models work, a visual intro to transformershttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vwjZofJX0v4M\n\nAfter spending years using encoderbased Transformer models, I started learning GPT models. Good opensource models like Llama 2 then appear. Then, I started finetuning these models using the excellent Unsloth library\n\n1. How to Finetune Llama3 and Export to Ollamahttpsdocs.unsloth.aitutorialshowtofinetunellama3andexporttoollama\n2. Finetune Llama 3.1 UltraEfficiently with Unslothhttpshuggingface.coblogmlabonnesftllama3\n\nAfter that, I focused on studying various RAG techniques and developing Agent AI systems. This is now called AI engineering, and, as far as I can see, it has become quite popular. So I'll write more about that in another post, but here I'll leave what I consider to be the three most famous representatives, i.e., their tutorials\n\n1. LangChain tutorialhttpspython.langchain.comdocstutorials\n2. LangGraph tutorialhttpslangchainai.github.iolanggraphtutorials\n3. CrewAI exampleshttpsgithub.comcrewAIInccrewAIexamples\n\n Here I am today\n\nThanks to the knowledge I've generated over all these years in the field of ML, I've developed and worked on numerous projects. The most significant publicly available project is developing an agent AI system for wellbeing support, which I turned into a mobile applicationhttpssintelly.comdownload. Also, my entire doctoral dissertation is related to applying ML to the stock market in combination with the development of GPT models and reinforcement learning more on that in a separate post. After long 6 years, I've completed my dissertation, and now I'm just waiting for its defense. I'll share everything I'm working on for the dissertation publicly on the projecthttpsprimoinvesting.com, and in tutorials I'm preparing to write.\n\nIf you're interested in these topics, I announce that I'll soon start with activities of publishing content on Medium and a blog, but I'll share all of that here on Reddit as well. Now that I've gathered years of experience and knowledge in this field, I'd like to share it with others and help as much as possible.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask them, and I'll try to answer all of them.\n\nThank you for reading."],["en","Throughout my computer science education and software engineering career, there was an emphasis on correctness.

I do know many friends that work on the experimental side, though.\n\nAs much as I appreciate the interest in my field over the last year or so, I personally think it's best to keep expectations realistic. Especially with some DD posts I have seen posting incomplete information, and even blatantly false statements in Physics. I want to clear those up and some personal thoughts on some quantum computing startups.\n\nQuantum communication doesn't allow for fasterthanlight propagation of information\n\nI have seen a DD post that says IonQ achieved faster than light communication via networked entanglement of particles. VERY common misconception about entanglement. Affecting one particle in a pair of entangled particles does not affect the other, it will just break the entanglement. It is proven to be impossible via the nocommunication theoremhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiNocommunication_theorem.\n\nBreaking Cryptography, more like breaking your portfolio as you baghold for 1020 years\n\nYes, Shor's algorithm is real. No, it won't be possible to break encryption until we get a quantum computer with at least 2000 qubits. The most optimal implementations  of Shor's algorithm requires around 2n qubits to factor an nbit number.\n\nAs an example for RSA1024, you'll need more than 2000 LOGICAL qubits. Factoring in error correction, which requires multiple PHYSICAL qubits to represent one single logical qubit, you'll most likely need upwards of 100k physical qubits before we can actually break realworld encryption. I personally see that taking at least 20 years, but some more optimistic estimates place it at 10 years.\n\nIonQ\n\nThere's many DD touting IonQ's lower error rates, longer lifetimes, and alltoall connectivity. While all of these are true, they often forget to mention one drawback the gate speeds.\n\nIt takes around a thousand times longer to execute an operation on trapped ion platforms compared to superconducting platforms which Google, IBM uses. While financetechbros that have never touched a quantum mechanics textbook will point to the fact that the lifetime of the qubit is at most on the order of 100 seconds, and think that quantum algorithms won't require more than that time anyways, so this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the algorithms that are most likely to see realworld use are optimization algorithms like VQE and QAOA. These algorithms need to repeat the quantum circuit many, many times as they gradually change the parameters in the circuit to find the optimal set of solutions.\n\nFurthermore, if your circuit output is some continuous variable that's encoded into the probability of measuring one of the states, then you need to repeat the circuit upwards of thousands of time to get a good estimate of that probability.\n\nAs a conservative estimate for a simple optimization algorithm, let's say that you need 1000 repetitions of the circuit, each one taking 1000 repetitions to get the output, and each run of the circuit takes 1 second on a trapped ion computer. That takes 11 and a half days on a trapped ion computer, as compared to 17 minutes on a superconducting one. If we use a paybytheminute model in the future for quantum computers, then IonQ likely has to charge less per minute, since you need more time to run an algorithm on their platform. Sure, they can charge a premium for the lower error rates, but if they charge the same amount per minute as superconducting platforms, then customers are likely to simplify the algorithm they want to run to be more tolerant of errors to get a solution at a thousandth of the price.\n\nRigetti\n\nHonestly, looking at their spec sheets for their platforms, and comparing it to Google's and IBM's, I don't see them pulling ahead at any point. Their board also literally kicked out the original founder for allegedly being a prick in general.\n\nQUBT\n\nLiterally never seen any substantial work from them.\n\nPositions\n\nhttpspreview.redd.it8d3hedfi4rqe1.png?width1080ampformatpngampautowebpampsf5c6f4e97de5dba5f0aa1ce08d44b6e959d16f03\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis is not financial advice.

I invest in space because I don't know space.

It just seemed like a gimmick with mediocre scifi graphics to sell magazines. I'm still not convinced, every video I've seen about it just sounds like bs, they all say the same nothings, like oh its way faster than super computers and is going to change everything, but they never really explain how it's supposed to work.\n\nOk, it uses cubit transistors that supposedly are in all possible states simultaneously or whatever, ok but how do you program that? Who's creating the programming languages that can utilize all possible states simultaneously logic? What kind of motherboard architecture can traffic all this insane amount of information?\n\nSupposedly it's not binary, but memory still is, right? The Internet is still binary, so are the quantum computers gonna have a classic computer onboard to convert the Internet into it's special number system, and then convert back to binary when it sends it out? I highly doubt the world is going to replace all computers with quantum, no way is that tech gonna fit in a phone, it needs a vacuum freezer room.\n\nWho's going to use it? Remember how long it took 64bit to replace 32bit? For long time 64bits was overkill for most programs, and I'm not super knowledgeable about all this, but i imagine we still haven't reached max potential as far as 64bit programming goes.\n\nHold your horses, things still take time. Remember when multi cores was a big deal? Well what programs are using those? I used to occasionally look at my processor analyzer to see if any programs i was running were using my extra cores, i don't think i have ever seen a program use more than 2 cores ever. Most new processors have like 8 or 12? Again I'm not super knowledgeable but i imagine it's cause most programs just don't need it or can't use it, like you can't just tell a program to split a bunch of instructions and send them to various processors, the program is linear and each set of instructions requires the one before it to happen first so it can use those results. Have fun trying to program something that happens all in one instance.\n\nHow does the math work? The beauty of transistors is they can form any logic gate necessary to solve any math equation. I have yet to see a single video that explains how cubits form logic gates or how any math is actually solved with them.\n\nIt's completely flawed, i just watched a video where a scientist explains that on average their quantum computer has an error once every hundred tries, that's an insanely high error rate. I don't care how far science gets, relying on a machine to read particle spins will always sound ridiculous. It's like when they dumped billions of dollars building that particle collider and the only clue they have as to anything actually colliding is finding blips in gigantic stacks of data, and from what i remember the expected data characteristics that indicate a successful appearance of the god particular only occurred once in every several million tries. I'm sure all those starving children are totally stoked on these breakthroughs.\n\nIs there something i missed? What do y'all think?

It's worth it, trust me."],["en","httpspreview.redd.itx8ih1fro28rd1.png?width1303ampformatpngampautowebpamps9e0a0be444f8de4b322b54c4bd2cb82824f63fe5\n\nYes, this is in response to the other guy, and I don't know what he's doing.Current Salary is 220k at a no RSU employer, and I know I could be making much more and will be looking to jump ship in the near future, just have to handle some things at my current employer for a bit.\n\nhttpspreview.redd.itmsojq9ca38rd1.png?width1616ampformatpngampautowebpamps8d8e1e093e4e3eee0ad0f1178ed0d16347550596\n\nEdit\n\nI did not expect this to get that much traction just wanted to show the other side due to the other post earlier. RIP my inbox, unfortunately I can't respond to everyone and I've repeated myself a couple times already so I'll just highlight the most common responses here. These are my opinions feel free to disagree.  \n  \nKnowledge Requisites  \nGetting a degree will certainly help you get your foot into the door in this field but it is not a golden ticket into entry level cyber security jobs. Cyber security exists as a field because IT and networking was built for the purposes of convenience and not for security. In order to understand cyber security fundamentals and concepts you must understand IT and networking at a high to advanced level. I mean how can you secure a bank if you don't know where the vault is or how it works? There's not really schooling that teaches that, you need to get hands on experience whether in a selfdesigned homelab or in the field of IT. Taking a cyber bootcamp or a couple udemycoursera courses is not going to cut it you really need to understand fundamental IT concepts and get your hands dirty. You might know people who got opportunities like that but they are the exception not the rule.  \n  \nDegrees  \nIf you are an undergrad studying computer science and minoring in cyberinformation security is the ideal pathway on my opinion. This way you'll learn programming, networking, IT and security fundamentals all at once. This also depends on your school so be sure to make sure your curriculum tackles all those things. Majoring in cybersecurity is alright as well just be sure the curriculum includes programming and networking courses. This is in addition to getting hands on experience in the field or on your own time as I mentioned above.  \n  \nIf you want to pursue a graduate degree my strongest recommendation is to have your employer or someone else pay for it. A Master's degree in cyber security means nothing without the prerequisite experience, I know because I have one and I only did it because it was paid for. Not to say that you won't learn anything but most people in this field value experience over degrees 10 times out of 10. A Master's degree will help you enter higher levels of management but you need experience to get to that level, right?  \n  \nCerts  \nSecurity, Network are the entry level certifications for this fieldb to demonstrate security and networking knowledge. These two certifications without experience will not get you an interview and if it does, be prepared to walk into a nightmare of a job. Other certifications are the CEH and Pentest which will help on the offensive side of things but also help train your mind on security practices. Coupling these certs with some hands on training like hackthebox and tryhackme will help you get she e really great hands on experience. Unfortunately you need to demonstrate this experience with either a job or a nice github profile.  \n  \nCISSP is the golden grail of certs in this fieldeven though it shouldn't be. It is highly respected and gets you past resume filters. If you have no experience do not study for or attempt a CISSP. Firstly you won't be granted one without 45 years experience and secondly no one will hire you.  \n\n\nOSCP is the golden grail for offensive security, but it is not for the faint of heart. This certification is extremely difficult and not entry level at all, do not attempt this without understanding IT fundamentals.\n\nTo recap, entry level certifications are helpful but you still need the requisite experience for them to be of value.\n\nThe Field  \nLot of questions like what is the day to day, and what do you do?   \nThe answer is that it depends. Cybersecurity isn't a single job it is a very broad field. Most domains are technical in nature, but fields like risk and compliance are a bit less technical. SOC analyst is what I would recommend for anyone starting out. A SOC analyst triages security alertsevents to identify if a security incident has taken place. This is a great starting point because it gives exposure to a lot of areas of the field of cybersecurity like Incident Response, Forensics, SIEM engineering, and the like. You also see a lot of attacks which gives you some insight into offensive security and defensive strategies as well. There are many more domains and areas so you really have to do your research and find out what catches your interest.\n\nSummary\n\nGet handson IT experience, get some schoolingfree preferred, take advantage of internships, and get some entry level certs to position yourself to start a career in cybersecurity. IF you're doing it for the money it's not likely to work out for you, sorry we're really good ad identifying BS."],["en","Hi everyone,\nBreaking into cybersecurity has always been tough, but now it's harder than ever. I've been in the field for 7 years, and during that time, I've earned certifications and degrees while working in various roles and industries. Based on my experience and conversations with hiring managers, directors, and VPs, I want to share some hard truths and advice about getting into the field. Keep in mind, this is just my perspectiveit won't apply to everyone, but this is what I've seen.\n\nCertifications Alone Aren't Enough\n\nYears ago, having certifications like Security or CySA was a big deal, but today, they don't hold the same weight. Certifications are still important, but the market is oversaturatedeveryone has them. Hiring managers are looking for more now, like degrees, technical experience, and specialized skills.\n\nIf you're relying solely on certifications, it's not impossible to break into the field, but it's definitely harder than it used to be.\n\nDegrees Are a GameChanger\n\nI've spoken with many hiring managers and VPs, and they've all said the same thing degrees still matter. Employers see them as a sign of a solid foundation in cybersecurity, especially from wellknown schools.\n\nFor example, I earned my master's in Information Security and Privacy from a very reputable school, and it opened doors for me that certifications alone couldn't. Hiring managers have told me to my face during the first week on the job that they only hired me because of the name of my school and how reputable it is.  Of course, there are more accessible options like WGU, but even WGU programs are getting saturated. If you're serious about breaking into the field, a degree paired with certifications is the way to go! \n\nThe Application Security Route\n\nIf you're trying to figure out the best way into cybersecurity, I highly recommend application security. It's one of the most underserved areas in the field, and there aren't enough people specializing in it. Companies are always looking for application security professionals, and it's a great way to stand out in a crowded market.\n\nThe Truth About TikTok Advice\n\nLet me be blunt most TikTok cybersecurity experts are lying or don't have the experience they claim. They make breaking into cybersecurity sound easy, and that's just not true. Many of them are doing it purely for views and clickbait.\n\nThat said, there are a few accounts I've found that give genuinely good advice\n\t\tCyber_Warrior\n\t\tAndrenajee\n\t\tSwenius\n\nThese are the only accounts I trust on TikTok. Everyone else? Ignore them. They're not in the field, they don't know what they're talking about, or they are in the field and just doing it to sell a course or make side money. They're doing more harm than good by misleading people.\n\nAlso, never pay for a mentor or someone promising to help you break into big tech. These people are scamming you. You don't need to pay anyone to succeed in this field. Focus on building real skills and networking with legitimate professionals.\n\nThe GRC Myth\n\nA lot of people think Governance, Risk, and Compliance GRC is an easy way into cybersecurity, but it's not as simple as it seems. Many GRC roles now require technical experience because you need to be able to explain technical issues to nontechnical stakeholders. While it's not impossible to get into GRC without a technical background, it's definitely harder. A better approach is to start with a technical role, like SOC analyst or application security, and transition into GRC later if that's your goal.\n\nAdvice and referrals \n\nLastly, I'm happy to refer people and give more advice but I need to be clear I will only refer Americans. Not to get political but trump is listening to Elon musk and Ramaswamy and bringing in hoards of Indians on H1B visa. The are paying them for a fraction of the cost as they would pay true hard working Americans. Getting tech jobs in general will be extremely hard for Americans. This is the reason why I will only be helping American citizens ONLY. \n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEveryone's journey is different, but this is what I've seen work for myself and others. It takes persistence and dedication, but if you put in the work, you'll get there.\n\nGood luck to everyone working toward their cybersecurity goals!"],["en","Been at it for around 10 years now.

Change my mind.\n\nHere is my experience\n\n I spent 8 years studying robotics in total.\n I did 3 internships where I literally paid to work at a robotics company travel, accommodation, zero salary.\n It still took 8 months to find my first job after bachelor's degree, which required moving across the country.\n I could have won many jobs both robotics and software simply by passing the C hiring tests, with no degree. The job I got was literally the only one that asked me robotics theory during the interview, the rest were all Googletype tech interviews.\n After working and further graduate study, it took me 4 months to find a more senior job at a lowertier robotics company. The famous robotics companies want either robotics PhDs, or software engineers from bigname companies so they can boast we are an exMeta exSpaceX exMicrosoft Robotics company lol wut?!.\n Also I noticed a large amount of mechanical and electrical engineering graduates becoming robot engineers and software engineers, simply by cramming for tech style interviews.\n Later we started to get many exUber, exAmazon and exMicrosoft software engineers join our company, with zero robotics experience, after they got firedPIP'd.\n My salary maxed out at 130,000.\n I got laidoff and took a nonrobotics software role while I kept searching, with no luck.\n The companies I'm trying to join are filled with people who did not study robotics engineering, or their previous role was at a nonrobotics company according to my LI research, yet they throw my resume in the trash.\n The need for a personal profile and public contributions. It's easy to showcase projects and opensource code from early in your career, but then later you get papered with NDAs and busy with family.\n\nI love robotics but this is a terrible investment in a career.\n\nThe reality is that a specialized robotics degree is no longer valued because most companies only need a small number of those people, and we now have a glut of PhDs in every specialization of robotics. Just like companies only need a small number of mechanical and electrical engineers to build out the robot product. Or people teach themselves the fundamentals via an online course e.g. Udacity.  \nAlso, like in any tech sector, it is affected by by outsourcing and immigration. Where's my specialist job that I studied for I'm currently resisting getting into SecretMIL work.\n\nAnother issue is that most pure robotics companies are terrible businesses. Every specific industry problem results in a new robotics startup e.g. A robot solution for mail sorting. A robot solution for picking tshirts. Essentially these startups are doing what a Systems Integrator would normally do. So they find a few customers for their specific product, then they struggle. Many are in the valley of death for 610 years. Many spent 100m with no viable product.\n\nI love building robotics but I feel bad when I did all this study and no one invites you to the party.\n\nChange my mind.\n\nltrantgt"],["en","Hi regards.

So, what scifi future shit is left to invest in? Robots, obviously!\n\nExcept, robots, like space rockets, are real.

As promised, I'll write a longer post about how I entered the world of ML, hoping it will help someone shape their path. I'll include links to all the useful materials I used alongside the story, which you can use for learning.\n\nI like to call myself an AI Research Scientist who enjoys exploring new AI trends, delving deeper into understanding their background, and applying them to real products. This way, I try to connect science and entrepreneurship because I believe everything that starts as scientific research ends up on the shelves as a product that solves a specific user problem.\n\nI began my journey in ML in 2016 when it wasn't such a popular field. Everyone had heard of it, but few were applying it. I have several years of development experience and want to try my hand at ML. The first problem I encountered was where to start  whether to learn mathematics, statistics, or something else. That's when I came across a name and a course that completely changed my career.\n\n Let's start\n\nYou guessed it. It was Professor Andrew Ng and his globally popular Machine Learning course available on Coursera I still have the certificate, hehe. This was also my first official online course ever. Since that course no longer exists as it's been replaced by a new one, I recommend you check out\n\n1. Machine Learning Stanford CS229httpswww.youtube.complaylist?listPLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU\n2. Machine Learning Specializationhttpswww.coursera.orgspecializationsmachinelearningintroduction\n\nThese two courses start from the basics of ML and all the necessary calculus you need to know. Many always ask questions like whether to learn linear algebra, statistics, or probability, but you don't need to know everything in depth. This knowledge helps if you're a scientist developing a new architecture, but as an engineer, not really. You need to know some basics to understand, such as how the backpropagation algorithm works.\n\nI know that Machine Learning Stanford CS229 is a very long and arduous course, but it's the right start if you want to be really good at ML. In my time, I filled two thick notebooks by hand while taking the course mentioned above.\n\n TensorFlow and Keras\n\nAfter the course, I didn't know how to apply my knowledge because I hadn't learned specifically how to code things. Then, I was looking for ways to learn how to code it. That's when I came across a popular framework called Keras, now part of TensorFlow. I started with a new course and acquiring practical knowledge\n\n1. Deep Learning Specializationhttpswww.coursera.orgspecializationsdeeplearning\n2. Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellowhttpswww.deeplearningbook.org\n3. Machine Learning Yearning by Andrew Nghttpsinfo.deeplearning.aimachinelearningyearningbook\n\nThese resources above were my next step. I must admit that I learned the most from that course and from the book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow because I like reading books although this one is quite difficult to read.\n\n Learn by coding\n\nTo avoid just learning, I went through various GitHub repositories that I manually retyped and learned that way. It may be an oldfashioned technique, but it helped me a lot. Now, most of those repositories don't exist, so I'll share some that I found to be good\n\n1. Really good Jupyter notebooks that can teach you the basics of TensorFlowhttpsgithub.commrdbourketensorflowdeeplearning\n2. Another good repo for learning TF and Kerashttpsgithub.comcodebasicsdeeplearningkerastftutorial\n\n Master the challenge\n\nAfter mastering the basics in terms of programming in TFKeras, I wanted to try solving some real problems. There's no better place for that challenge than Kaggle and the popular Titanic dataset. Here, you can really find a bunch of materials and simple examples of ML applications. Here are some of my favorites\n\n1. Titanic  Machine Learning from Disasterhttpswww.kaggle.comctitanicoverview\n2. Home Credit Default Riskhttpswww.kaggle.comcompetitionshomecreditdefaultriskoverview\n3. House Prices  Advanced Regression Techniqueshttpswww.kaggle.comcompetitionshousepricesadvancedregressiontechniques\n4. Two Sigma Using News to Predict Stock Movementshttpswww.kaggle.comcompetitionstwosigmafinancialnews\n\nI then decided to further develop my career in the direction of applying ML to the stock market, first using predictions on time series and then using natural language processing. I've remained in this field until today and will defend my doctoral dissertation soon.\n\n How to deploy models\n\nTo continue, before I move on to the topic of specialization, we need to address the topic of deployment. Now that we've learned how to make some basic models in Keras and how to use them, there are many ways and services, but I'll only mention what I use today. For all my ML models, whether simple regression models or complex GPT models, I use FastAPI. It's a straightforward framework, and you can quickly create API endpoints. I'll share a few older and useful tutorials for beginners\n\n1. AI as an API tutorial serieshttpswww.youtube.comwatch?v56qQNcHJxyQ\n2. A stepbystep guidehttpsmedium.comganiyuabdulwajeed2002astepbystepapproachtobuildingafastapifordeeplearningclassificationprojectscbd2ea6bc2f2\n3. Productizing an ML Model with FastAPI and Cloud Runhttpsmedium.comsemantixbrdeployanmlmodelwithfastapiandcloudrunpart11a0b0f3b3a5d\n\nPersonally, I've deployed on various cloud providers, of which I would highlight GCP and AWS because they have everything needed for model deployment, and if you know how to use them, they can be quite cheap.\n\n Chose your specialization\n\nThe next step in developing my career, besides choosing finance as the primary area, was my specialization in the field of NLP. This happened in early 2020 when I started working with models based on the Transformer architecture. The first model I worked with was BERT, and the first tasks were related to classifications. My recommendations are to master the Transformer architecture well because 99 of today's LLM models are based on it. Here are some resources\n\n1. The legendary paper Attention Is All You Needhttpsproceedings.neurips.ccpaper_filespaper2017file3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aaPaper.pdf\n2. Hugging Face Course on Transformershttpshuggingface.colearnnlpcoursechapter11\n3. Illustrated Guide to Transformers  Step by Step Explanationhttpstowardsdatascience.comillustratedguidetotransformersstepbystepexplanationf74876522bc0\n4. Good repositoryhttpsgithub.comNielsRoggeTransformersTutorials\n5. How large language models work, a visual intro to transformershttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vwjZofJX0v4M\n\nAfter spending years using encoderbased Transformer models, I started learning GPT models. Good opensource models like Llama 2 then appear. Then, I started finetuning these models using the excellent Unsloth library\n\n1. How to Finetune Llama3 and Export to Ollamahttpsdocs.unsloth.aitutorialshowtofinetunellama3andexporttoollama\n2. Finetune Llama 3.1 UltraEfficiently with Unslothhttpshuggingface.coblogmlabonnesftllama3\n\nAfter that, I focused on studying various RAG techniques and developing Agent AI systems. This is now called AI engineering, and, as far as I can see, it has become quite popular. So I'll write more about that in another post, but here I'll leave what I consider to be the three most famous representatives, i.e., their tutorials\n\n1. LangChain tutorialhttpspython.langchain.comdocstutorials\n2. LangGraph tutorialhttpslangchainai.github.iolanggraphtutorials\n3. CrewAI exampleshttpsgithub.comcrewAIInccrewAIexamples\n\n Here I am today\n\nThanks to the knowledge I've generated over all these years in the field of ML, I've developed and worked on numerous projects. The most significant publicly available project is developing an agent AI system for wellbeing support, which I turned into a mobile applicationhttpssintelly.comdownload. Also, my entire doctoral dissertation is related to applying ML to the stock market in combination with the development of GPT models and reinforcement learning more on that in a separate post. After long 6 years, I've completed my dissertation, and now I'm just waiting for its defense. I'll share everything I'm working on for the dissertation publicly on the projecthttpsprimoinvesting.com, and in tutorials I'm preparing to write.\n\nIf you're interested in these topics, I announce that I'll soon start with activities of publishing content on Medium and a blog, but I'll share all of that here on Reddit as well. Now that I've gathered years of experience and knowledge in this field, I'd like to share it with others and help as much as possible.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask them, and I'll try to answer all of them.\n\nThank you for reading."},{"answer":"Throughout my computer science education and software engineering career, there was an emphasis on correctness. You can write tests to demonstrate the invariants of the code are true and edge cases are handled. And you can explain why some code is safe against race conditions and will consistently produce the same result.\n\nWith machine learning, especially neural network based models, proofs are replaced with measurements. Rather than carefully explaining why code is correct, you have to measure model accuracy and quality instead based on inputsoutputs, while the model itself has become more of a black box.\n\nI find that ML lacks the rigor associated with CS because its less explainable."},{"answer":"I just wanted to ask how difficult is machine learning?

What Happens Next.nbspnbspBarron's"},{"answer":"New post, now with screenshot.\n\nMy background PhD student in Physics, working on quantum information on the theory side. I do know many friends that work on the experimental side, though.\n\nAs much as I appreciate the interest in my field over the last year or so, I personally think it's best to keep expectations realistic. Especially with some DD posts I have seen posting incomplete information, and even blatantly false statements in Physics. I want to clear those up and some personal thoughts on some quantum computing startups.\n\nQuantum communication doesn't allow for fasterthanlight propagation of information\n\nI have seen a DD post that says IonQ achieved faster than light communication via networked entanglement of particles. VERY common misconception about entanglement. Affecting one particle in a pair of entangled particles does not affect the other, it will just break the entanglement. It is proven to be impossible via the nocommunication theoremhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiNocommunication_theorem.\n\nBreaking Cryptography, more like breaking your portfolio as you baghold for 1020 years\n\nYes, Shor's algorithm is real. No, it won't be possible to break encryption until we get a quantum computer with at least 2000 qubits. The most optimal implementations  of Shor's algorithm requires around 2n qubits to factor an nbit number.\n\nAs an example for RSA1024, you'll need more than 2000 LOGICAL qubits. Factoring in error correction, which requires multiple PHYSICAL qubits to represent one single logical qubit, you'll most likely need upwards of 100k physical qubits before we can actually break realworld encryption. I personally see that taking at least 20 years, but some more optimistic estimates place it at 10 years.\n\nIonQ\n\nThere's many DD touting IonQ's lower error rates, longer lifetimes, and alltoall connectivity. While all of these are true, they often forget to mention one drawback the gate speeds.\n\nIt takes around a thousand times longer to execute an operation on trapped ion platforms compared to superconducting platforms which Google, IBM uses. While financetechbros that have never touched a quantum mechanics textbook will point to the fact that the lifetime of the qubit is at most on the order of 100 seconds, and think that quantum algorithms won't require more than that time anyways, so this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the algorithms that are most likely to see realworld use are optimization algorithms like VQE and QAOA. These algorithms need to repeat the quantum circuit many, many times as they gradually change the parameters in the circuit to find the optimal set of solutions.\n\nFurthermore, if your circuit output is some continuous variable that's encoded into the probability of measuring one of the states, then you need to repeat the circuit upwards of thousands of time to get a good estimate of that probability.\n\nAs a conservative estimate for a simple optimization algorithm, let's say that you need 1000 repetitions of the circuit, each one taking 1000 repetitions to get the output, and each run of the circuit takes 1 second on a trapped ion computer. That takes 11 and a half days on a trapped ion computer, as compared to 17 minutes on a superconducting one. If we use a paybytheminute model in the future for quantum computers, then IonQ likely has to charge less per minute, since you need more time to run an algorithm on their platform. Sure, they can charge a premium for the lower error rates, but if they charge the same amount per minute as superconducting platforms, then customers are likely to simplify the algorithm they want to run to be more tolerant of errors to get a solution at a thousandth of the price.\n\nRigetti\n\nHonestly, looking at their spec sheets for their platforms, and comparing it to Google's and IBM's, I don't see them pulling ahead at any point. Their board also literally kicked out the original founder for allegedly being a prick in general.\n\nQUBT\n\nLiterally never seen any substantial work from them.\n\nPositions\n\nhttpspreview.redd.it8d3hedfi4rqe1.png?width1080ampformatpngampautowebpampsf5c6f4e97de5dba5f0aa1ce08d44b6e959d16f03\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis is not financial advice. I've literally got my portfolio tied up in RKLB and LUNR because I don't know anything about space outside of Kerbal Space Program. I don't invest in quantum because I know quantum. I invest in space because I don't know space. Someone please make a similar post about space to convince me that space is bad too so I'll finally put my money into VOO and QQQ."},{"answer":"I've been skeptical about quantum computing for years since the first time i read about it in some science magazine. It just seemed like a gimmick with mediocre scifi graphics to sell magazines. I'm still not convinced, every video I've seen about it just sounds like bs, they all say the same nothings, like oh its way faster than super computers and is going to change everything, but they never really explain how it's supposed to work.\n\nOk, it uses cubit transistors that supposedly are in all possible states simultaneously or whatever, ok but how do you program that? Who's creating the programming languages that can utilize all possible states simultaneously logic? What kind of motherboard architecture can traffic all this insane amount of information?\n\nSupposedly it's not binary, but memory still is, right? The Internet is still binary, so are the quantum computers gonna have a classic computer onboard to convert the Internet into it's special number system, and then convert back to binary when it sends it out? I highly doubt the world is going to replace all computers with quantum, no way is that tech gonna fit in a phone, it needs a vacuum freezer room.\n\nWho's going to use it? Remember how long it took 64bit to replace 32bit? For long time 64bits was overkill for most programs, and I'm not super knowledgeable about all this, but i imagine we still haven't reached max potential as far as 64bit programming goes.\n\nHold your horses, things still take time. Remember when multi cores was a big deal? Well what programs are using those? I used to occasionally look at my processor analyzer to see if any programs i was running were using my extra cores, i don't think i have ever seen a program use more than 2 cores ever. Most new processors have like 8 or 12? Again I'm not super knowledgeable but i imagine it's cause most programs just don't need it or can't use it, like you can't just tell a program to split a bunch of instructions and send them to various processors, the program is linear and each set of instructions requires the one before it to happen first so it can use those results. Have fun trying to program something that happens all in one instance.\n\nHow does the math work? The beauty of transistors is they can form any logic gate necessary to solve any math equation. I have yet to see a single video that explains how cubits form logic gates or how any math is actually solved with them.\n\nIt's completely flawed, i just watched a video where a scientist explains that on average their quantum computer has an error once every hundred tries, that's an insanely high error rate. I don't care how far science gets, relying on a machine to read particle spins will always sound ridiculous. It's like when they dumped billions of dollars building that particle collider and the only clue they have as to anything actually colliding is finding blips in gigantic stacks of data, and from what i remember the expected data characteristics that indicate a successful appearance of the god particular only occurred once in every several million tries. I'm sure all those starving children are totally stoked on these breakthroughs.\n\nIs there something i missed? What do y'all think? Is quantum computing a load of bs or am i just embarrassing myself?

This is something really overlooked in the marketingHR whatever cybersecurity hype business.\n\nI've worked in cybersecurity for about a year and a half as a technical specialist on an auditing team. My job involves making sure our clients have all their security measures in place, from network segmentation to IAM, IDSIPS, SIEM, and cryptography. I like the overlap with governance, and I also appreciate the opportunity to see a range of different companies and network architectures.\n\nBut if I could go back, I'd start in one of those junior roles I mentioned earlier. Cybersecurity is rooted in a solid understanding of networking, and it can be tough to get into if you don't have any prior experience. Studying the subject and earning certifications can help, of course, but nothing beats the realworld experience of working directly with a large enterprise network.\n\nSo, that's just my personal piece of advice. It's a fantastic field, and you're bound to learn heaps regardless of the path you choose. But don't get too dazzled by the glamour. Be patient, start from the basics, and work your way up.

RIP my inbox, unfortunately I can't respond to everyone and I've repeated myself a couple times already so I'll just highlight the most common responses here. These are my opinions feel free to disagree.  \n  \nKnowledge Requisites  \nGetting a degree will certainly help you get your foot into the door in this field but it is not a golden ticket into entry level cyber security jobs. Cyber security exists as a field because IT and networking was built for the purposes of convenience and not for security. In order to understand cyber security fundamentals and concepts you must understand IT and networking at a high to advanced level. I mean how can you secure a bank if you don't know where the vault is or how it works? There's not really schooling that teaches that, you need to get hands on experience whether in a selfdesigned homelab or in the field of IT. Taking a cyber bootcamp or a couple udemycoursera courses is not going to cut it you really need to understand fundamental IT concepts and get your hands dirty. You might know people who got opportunities like that but they are the exception not the rule.  \n  \nDegrees  \nIf you are an undergrad studying computer science and minoring in cyberinformation security is the ideal pathway on my opinion. This way you'll learn programming, networking, IT and security fundamentals all at once. This also depends on your school so be sure to make sure your curriculum tackles all those things. Majoring in cybersecurity is alright as well just be sure the curriculum includes programming and networking courses. This is in addition to getting hands on experience in the field or on your own time as I mentioned above.  \n  \nIf you want to pursue a graduate degree my strongest recommendation is to have your employer or someone else pay for it. A Master's degree in cyber security means nothing without the prerequisite experience, I know because I have one and I only did it because it was paid for. Not to say that you won't learn anything but most people in this field value experience over degrees 10 times out of 10. A Master's degree will help you enter higher levels of management but you need experience to get to that level, right?  \n  \nCerts  \nSecurity, Network are the entry level certifications for this fieldb to demonstrate security and networking knowledge. These two certifications without experience will not get you an interview and if it does, be prepared to walk into a nightmare of a job. Other certifications are the CEH and Pentest which will help on the offensive side of things but also help train your mind on security practices. Coupling these certs with some hands on training like hackthebox and tryhackme will help you get she e really great hands on experience. Unfortunately you need to demonstrate this experience with either a job or a nice github profile.  \n  \nCISSP is the golden grail of certs in this fieldeven though it shouldn't be. It is highly respected and gets you past resume filters. If you have no experience do not study for or attempt a CISSP. Firstly you won't be granted one without 45 years experience and secondly no one will hire you.  \n\n\nOSCP is the golden grail for offensive security, but it is not for the faint of heart. This certification is extremely difficult and not entry level at all, do not attempt this without understanding IT fundamentals.\n\nTo recap, entry level certifications are helpful but you still need the requisite experience for them to be of value.\n\nThe Field  \nLot of questions like what is the day to day, and what do you do?   \nThe answer is that it depends. Cybersecurity isn't a single job it is a very broad field. Most domains are technical in nature, but fields like risk and compliance are a bit less technical. SOC analyst is what I would recommend for anyone starting out. A SOC analyst triages security alertsevents to identify if a security incident has taken place. This is a great starting point because it gives exposure to a lot of areas of the field of cybersecurity like Incident Response, Forensics, SIEM engineering, and the like. You also see a lot of attacks which gives you some insight into offensive security and defensive strategies as well. There are many more domains and areas so you really have to do your research and find out what catches your interest.\n\nSummary\n\nGet handson IT experience, get some schoolingfree preferred, take advantage of internships, and get some entry level certs to position yourself to start a career in cybersecurity. IF you're doing it for the money it's not likely to work out for you, sorry we're really good ad identifying BS."},{"answer":"Hi everyone,\nBreaking into cybersecurity has always been tough, but now it's harder than ever. I've been in the field for 7 years, and during that time, I've earned certifications and degrees while working in various roles and industries. Based on my experience and conversations with hiring managers, directors, and VPs, I want to share some hard truths and advice about getting into the field. Keep in mind, this is just my perspectiveit won't apply to everyone, but this is what I've seen.\n\nCertifications Alone Aren't Enough\n\nYears ago, having certifications like Security or CySA was a big deal, but today, they don't hold the same weight. Certifications are still important, but the market is oversaturatedeveryone has them. Hiring managers are looking for more now, like degrees, technical experience, and specialized skills.\n\nIf you're relying solely on certifications, it's not impossible to break into the field, but it's definitely harder than it used to be.\n\nDegrees Are a GameChanger\n\nI've spoken with many hiring managers and VPs, and they've all said the same thing degrees still matter. Employers see them as a sign of a solid foundation in cybersecurity, especially from wellknown schools.\n\nFor example, I earned my master's in Information Security and Privacy from a very reputable school, and it opened doors for me that certifications alone couldn't. Hiring managers have told me to my face during the first week on the job that they only hired me because of the name of my school and how reputable it is.  Of course, there are more accessible options like WGU, but even WGU programs are getting saturated. If you're serious about breaking into the field, a degree paired with certifications is the way to go! \n\nThe Application Security Route\n\nIf you're trying to figure out the best way into cybersecurity, I highly recommend application security. It's one of the most underserved areas in the field, and there aren't enough people specializing in it. Companies are always looking for application security professionals, and it's a great way to stand out in a crowded market.\n\nThe Truth About TikTok Advice\n\nLet me be blunt most TikTok cybersecurity experts are lying or don't have the experience they claim. They make breaking into cybersecurity sound easy, and that's just not true. Many of them are doing it purely for views and clickbait.\n\nThat said, there are a few accounts I've found that give genuinely good advice\n\t\tCyber_Warrior\n\t\tAndrenajee\n\t\tSwenius\n\nThese are the only accounts I trust on TikTok. Everyone else? Ignore them. They're not in the field, they don't know what they're talking about, or they are in the field and just doing it to sell a course or make side money. They're doing more harm than good by misleading people.\n\nAlso, never pay for a mentor or someone promising to help you break into big tech. These people are scamming you. You don't need to pay anyone to succeed in this field. Focus on building real skills and networking with legitimate professionals.\n\nThe GRC Myth\n\nA lot of people think Governance, Risk, and Compliance GRC is an easy way into cybersecurity, but it's not as simple as it seems. Many GRC roles now require technical experience because you need to be able to explain technical issues to nontechnical stakeholders. While it's not impossible to get into GRC without a technical background, it's definitely harder. A better approach is to start with a technical role, like SOC analyst or application security, and transition into GRC later if that's your goal.\n\nAdvice and referrals \n\nLastly, I'm happy to refer people and give more advice but I need to be clear I will only refer Americans. Not to get political but trump is listening to Elon musk and Ramaswamy and bringing in hoards of Indians on H1B visa. The are paying them for a fraction of the cost as they would pay true hard working Americans. Getting tech jobs in general will be extremely hard for Americans. This is the reason why I will only be helping American citizens ONLY. \n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEveryone's journey is different, but this is what I've seen work for myself and others. It takes persistence and dedication, but if you put in the work, you'll get there.\n\nGood luck to everyone working toward their cybersecurity goals!"},{"answer":"Been at it for around 10 years now.

Change my mind.\n\nHere is my experience\n\n I spent 8 years studying robotics in total.\n I did 3 internships where I literally paid to work at a robotics company travel, accommodation, zero salary.\n It still took 8 months to find my first job after bachelor's degree, which required moving across the country.\n I could have won many jobs both robotics and software simply by passing the C hiring tests, with no degree. The job I got was literally the only one that asked me robotics theory during the interview, the rest were all Googletype tech interviews.\n After working and further graduate study, it took me 4 months to find a more senior job at a lowertier robotics company. The famous robotics companies want either robotics PhDs, or software engineers from bigname companies so they can boast we are an exMeta exSpaceX exMicrosoft Robotics company lol wut?!.\n Also I noticed a large amount of mechanical and electrical engineering graduates becoming robot engineers and software engineers, simply by cramming for tech style interviews.\n Later we started to get many exUber, exAmazon and exMicrosoft software engineers join our company, with zero robotics experience, after they got firedPIP'd.\n My salary maxed out at 130,000.\n I got laidoff and took a nonrobotics software role while I kept searching, with no luck.\n The companies I'm trying to join are filled with people who did not study robotics engineering, or their previous role was at a nonrobotics company according to my LI research, yet they throw my resume in the trash.\n The need for a personal profile and public contributions. It's easy to showcase projects and opensource code from early in your career, but then later you get papered with NDAs and busy with family.\n\nI love robotics but this is a terrible investment in a career.\n\nThe reality is that a specialized robotics degree is no longer valued because most companies only need a small number of those people, and we now have a glut of PhDs in every specialization of robotics. Just like companies only need a small number of mechanical and electrical engineers to build out the robot product. Or people teach themselves the fundamentals via an online course e.g. Udacity.  \nAlso, like in any tech sector, it is affected by by outsourcing and immigration. Where's my specialist job that I studied for I'm currently resisting getting into SecretMIL work.\n\nAnother issue is that most pure robotics companies are terrible businesses. Every specific industry problem results in a new robotics startup e.g. A robot solution for mail sorting. A robot solution for picking tshirts. Essentially these startups are doing what a Systems Integrator would normally do. So they find a few customers for their specific product, then they struggle. Many are in the valley of death for 610 years. Many spent 100m with no viable product.\n\nI love building robotics but I feel bad when I did all this study and no one invites you to the party.\n\nChange my mind.\n\nltrantgt"},{"answer":"Hi regards.

I'm gonna call this trend shit we thought we'd have in the future because we watched a lot of scifi movies. 2024 was the year of AI, then it was the space stocks RKLB, LUNR, etc. Then it was the flying car stocks ARCH, JOBY, etc. Then we all saw the quantum stock bubble though any regard with a CS degree could have told you the same thing that Jensen did. So, what scifi future shit is left to invest in? Robots, obviously!\n\nExcept, robots, like space rockets, are real. And they're already in market and getting better rapidly. 2025 is the year when they'll really start to go mainstream, largely because software is the biggest limiting factor to how good robots are today. With recent advancements in AI, robots are going to start getting A LOT better.\n\nFurther supporting my bullish thesis is NVIDIA's recent release of their Cosmos Wold Foundation Model  httpsnvidianews.nvidia.comnewsnvidialaunchescosmosworldfoundationmodelplatformtoacceleratephysicalaidevelopment. Why is this a big deal? because, this will really lower the cost of entry for the robot manufacturers as they won't have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to train a vision model by themselves. Now they can just equip their bots with some commodity sensors amp cameras and build out the hardware bot for their use case.\n\nPositions\n\nDue to marketcap requirements here, the only one I can mention is SERV  holding 2000 shares and 20 LEAP contracts for May.\n\nI have a bag of bunch of other tickers in the space that have a 250500M valuation."},{"answer":"5 days ago  Charge Robotics, founded by MIT alumni, has created a system that automatically assembles and installs completed sections of large solar farms.
